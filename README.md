# Tower Defense

This is a starting Tower defense game.

It includes all basic features from a tower defense.

## Getting Started
Main code is in *frontend/app/index.js*

If you're not too familiar with P5.js, [there's some great documentation on their website](https://p5js.org/reference/)!

## How to play
To place turrets, simply click on their image on the top right. They will be placed automatically.
To launch waves, press space.

## Objective
If you are not familiar with a Tower defense game, the objective is to kill all enemies before they get to the end.
